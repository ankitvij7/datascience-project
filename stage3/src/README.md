#Needed Python Libraries for code & Jupyter Notebook:
Using PyCharm include in your interpreter:
1. python - 3.6
1. Jupyter - 1.0.0
1. matplotlib - 2.2.2
1. sympy - 1.1.1
1. py_entitymatching - 0.3.0
1. scipy  - 1.0.1

Care should be taken to not leave the "ipynb" file open when editing in the browser. I had issues with saving and PyCharm.

Create a configuration of a Jupyter Notebook: specify Host and Port in the root of stage 3 directory.
